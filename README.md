# AssessmentPortal
This is an MCQ-based Online Assessment Portal that caters different questions to different test-takers. The questions are randomly taken up from a pool of questions that are stored in the MySQL database. HTML, CSS and Javascript (alongwith some jQuery code) have been used for designing the front-end of this Portal.
